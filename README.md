# dagger-retrofit-2.0-mvvm
Sample of a basic app using Dagger 2 and Retrofit 2 and an MVVM pattern

This is a demo of a nice base for an application. It includes
- MVVM pattern
- Dagger 2.0 for dependency injection
- Butterknife for cutting out some boilerplate code
- RetroFit 2.0, and Gson for handling REST APIs
- Calligraphy for custom fonts

## To Run Test
- switch the Build Variant to ```Unit Tests```

## Future Builds
- Some Custom fonts for Calligraphy to show off
- Navigation Service to handle moving between Activities
- Login / Logout through a UserService
- Single Activity Interface with no Fragments (I dislike the Fragment lifecycle and Fragment Transaction)
